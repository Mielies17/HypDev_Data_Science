# Exploratory Data Analysis

## Description
This is an in depth exploratory data analysis on the Titanic.csv file using Python, pandas and other data science libraries in Jupyter Notebook.

The following were used as guiding questions, but they weren't the only investigations made on the dataset:
 - Does the data show that preference on lifeboats were given to upper-class passengers as mentioned in the movie?
 - "Women and children first". Was this the case?

## Files
