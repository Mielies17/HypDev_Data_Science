# Unsupervised Machine Learning Model

## Description
This project looks at the US Arrests dataset in which EDA was performed to look at different
crime rates across the US in 1973. Principle component analysis was applied to reduce the
dimensionality and redundancy of the dataset followed by hierarchical clustering using 
dendrograms as well as K-means clustering (both of which are unsupervised learning algorithms).
