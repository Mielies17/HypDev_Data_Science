# Supervised Machine Learning Model

## Description
This project looks at the customer churn history of the Telco industry. There was EDA
performed to look at different relationships between the various features of the dataset.
The goal was to use the data and train a logistic regression model as well as a random
forest model (both of which are supervised learning algorithms)to asses which would 
better forecast customer churn.
