# Multiple Linear Regression on Ames housing data

## Description
The dataset used in this notebook contains information about houses in Ames, Iowa. The data was collected by the Ames City Assessor’s Office describing 2930 property sales which occurred in Ames, Iowa between 2006 and 2010. The goal of this task is to analyze the relationship between different features of the dataset and build a multiple linear regression model to make predictions on sales prices based on 'Gr_Liv_Area' and 'Garage_Area` features.
